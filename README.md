Random tools made by (and/or for) Luna :3

## ClipKey
ClipKey is a simple flatsceen app made to be attached to your wrist (or anywhere) in VR, (Using XSOverlay, OVRToolkit or similar) which can be used to clip moments using an app like Medal. Originally intended to be used for moderation, but feel free to use it for anything!
Use left click to clip (duh) and use right click to be given 5 seconds for you to start recording the keybind in your desired app (like, again... Medal).

## OVRTK Notifications 
OVRToolkit Notifications is a simple example of a script that can send notifications to OVRToolkit using their newly announced websocket protocol.
Feel free to use this for any project you'd like, with or without credit. (This is too simple to demand credit for lmao)

## SpicetifyInstall
SpicetifyInstall is a VERY simple script that literally just installs thevSpicetify tweak automatically.
